GITHUB GENERAL WORKFLOW
=================================================================================

- Don't keep a generic master branch
- Work VERTICALLY by starting features with branching from some "master-vX.X" version; feel free to start many features on master to work on in parallel.
- Create new "master-vX.X" branches to progress the old "master-vX.X" version with an added feature; do that only WHEN THE NEW FEATURE IS COMPLETED and potentially stable 
- If you need a complete different version of master, work HORIZONTALLY by creating a VERSION BRANCH LIKE: "master-[version]-vX.X". 
    Example: "master-online-v1.0" 
  And then you work vertically on that new version as a separate progression.

Vertical workflow example:
- Create master-v3.0 from master-v2.0
- Create feature_branch from master-v3.0
- Work on feature_branch
- Merge feature_branch on master-v3.0
- When enough features are merged on master-v3.0 such that you may call it a new version, create master-v4.0 and start adding features there!

Always work on specific feature branches; this helps you focus on what needs to be done! Makes the features as small as you like, just work like that!
